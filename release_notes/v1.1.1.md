## v1.1.1 [HOTFIX] CBOR handling...Again

### Fixes and Improvements for `cbor_decode_jsonb`

In this release, we've addressed a subtle but critical issue in CBOR decoding logic:
**Byte strings starting with valid CBOR prefixes were being mistakenly interpreted as nested CBOR objects**, even when the full payload was not a complete CBOR structure.

This could lead to incorrect parsing or even runtime errors in edge cases involving hex-encoded binary data, especially for CBOR maps containing `Bytes` values.

The fix ensures that:

* Nested CBOR parsing now only happens if the byte string **fully conforms to a complete CBOR structure**.
* Partial or ambiguous prefixes are safely treated as raw binary data.

This makes the behavior of `cbor_decode_jsonb` and related functions significantly more predictable and correct.

### Release Notes:

* Fixed: Prevented false-positive CBOR decoding inside `cbor_decode_jsonb`
* Improved test coverage for edge cases in CBOR decoding
