# v1.0.5-p1 Better CBOR<->JSONB conversion
## This is quite an important release for several reasons:
### **KOIOS Collaboration & CIP-88 Support**
Our friends at KOIOS came up with the idea of implementing a function for convenient validation of key registration according to their proposed CIP-88 standard. This release owes its existence to that collaboration.

It has a rather unusual tag: **`v1.0.5-p1`**, where `p1` stands for **"phase 1"**. This is a full-fledged release, not a betaâ€”it is simply divided into two phases.

- **Phase 1** introduces the implementation of `tools_verify_cip88_pool_key_registration` as an SQL procedure that utilizes multiple calls to native code instead of a fully native implementation. Essentially, this is a prototype, but one that is production-ready and fully tested.
- **Phase 2** (`v1.0.5-p2`) will provide the same functionality but as a purely native implementation, **_without changing the function signature_**. The only difference will be improved performance. ðŸš€

### **CBOR<->JSONB Improvements**
During development, we uncovered several inconsistencies in repeated CBOR<->JSONB serialization and deserialization, which have now been fixed. This makes the release not just important but also highly beneficial.

1) **Enhanced CBOR->JSONB Encoder**
    - The encoder now properly serializes `bytea` as **hex-encoded** rather than a **hex-like string**.
    - This makes CBOR output more compact.
    - It also aligns the serialization process with `cardano-cli`.

2) **Fixing JSONB Bytearray Handling**
    - JSONB does not have a native `bytearray` type; it is always passed as a **hex-encoded string**, which, in some cases, was still stored as text.
    - This limitation has been successfully worked around, making the handling more robust than ever.

3) **New Function: `cbor_decode_jsonb_hex2bytea`**
    - Correct encoding of `bytea` into CBOR is important, but so is **correct decoding**.
    - Instead of modifying the existing `cbor_decode_jsonb` function (which could introduce regressions for users), a new function, `cbor_decode_jsonb_hex2bytea`, was introduced to handle this properly.
