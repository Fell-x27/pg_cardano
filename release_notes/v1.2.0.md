## v1.2.0 Parser Control, Function Metadata, and PG18 Support

### More control for CBOR decoding

This release introduces an optional `aggressive` flag for:

- `cardano.cbor_decode_jsonb(bytea[, boolean])`
- `cardano.cbor_decode_jsonb_hex2bytea(bytea[, boolean])`

The new flag allows explicit control over how aggressively nested CBOR is unfolded.

- `aggressive = true` preserves the previous behavior.
- `aggressive = false` applies a safer, less aggressive parsing strategy.

This change is backward-compatible because single-argument calls keep working and map to `aggressive = true`.

### PostgreSQL function metadata

Metadata was added to exported functions:

- `immutable`
- `strict`
- `parallel_safe`

This helps PostgreSQL optimize execution plans, allows better caching opportunities, and improves index/query-planner behavior for deterministic functions.

### Platform/version support changes

- Added PostgreSQL 18 support.
- Dropped support for PostgreSQL versions below 15.

### Release Notes:

- Added PostgreSQL 18 support
- Added optional `aggressive` argument to `cbor_decode_jsonb` and `cbor_decode_jsonb_hex2bytea`
- Preserved backward compatibility (`bytea`-only calls still behave as `aggressive = true`)
- Improved CBOR nested parsing control
- Added `immutable`, `strict`, and `parallel_safe` metadata to exported functions
- Added more tests
- Dropped PostgreSQL versions below 15
