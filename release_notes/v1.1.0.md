# v1.1.0 Ultimate CBOR<->JSON Conversion
## **New codebase, new features, new platforms!**

### **New Functions: `cbor*_ext`**
From the very first version, `pg_cardano` has supported CBOR<->JSON conversion, but this support has always been highly compromised.  
Pure JSON is extremely limited compared to CBOR: it doesn't support arbitrary key types, maps and sets, tags, binary data, and so on.

Some of these issues were addressed in previous versions of `pg_cardano`, and the existing functions were sufficient for many use cases â€” but not all.

We are proud to introduce two new functions: `cbor_decode_jsonb_ext` and `cbor_encode_jsonb_ext`. The `_ext` stands for *extended*. These functions allow full-featured CBOR<->JSON conversion without limitations.

They operate on JSON with a strict data schema that captures all the nuances of CBOR. With these, you can now convert complex CBOR structures to and from JSON **without any data loss**.

More details are available in the documentation.

### **Dropped `serde_cbor`**
Previous versions of `pg_cardano` used the `serde_cbor` library for CBOR handling, but it came with many issues. It lacked full CBOR compliance, offered no control over CBOR structure, and â€” most importantly â€” it is no longer maintained.

We have migrated to `ciborium`, a modern alternative that improves upon `serde_cbor` without its drawbacks.  
This transition did not affect performance, but required substantial work under the hood.

### **More Platforms Supported**
`pg_cardano` is now available for the following platforms:
1) Linux x64
2) Linux ARM
3) macOS x64 (<=13)
4) macOS ARM (>13)

## **Release Notes:**
1) Added `cbor_decode_jsonb_ext` and `cbor_encode_jsonb_ext` functions
2) Removed `serde_cbor` from dependencies
3) Updated `release.sh` script
4) Updated `README.md`
5) Updated migrations
6) Updated tests
7) Added support for new platforms
