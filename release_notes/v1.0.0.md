# v1.0.0
### Release Notes

This release of the `pg_cardano` PostgreSQL extension provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with cryptographic operations and Cardano-specific functionalities directly within PostgreSQL:

---

### **1. Base58 Encoding/Decoding:**
- Encode and decode data using the Base58 encoding scheme, which is widely used in blockchain applications for compact and human-readable representations of binary data.

### **2. Bech32 Encoding/Decoding:**
- Supports encoding and decoding of Bech32, a common format used in Cardano for addresses and other data structures.

### **3. CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) Encoding/Decoding:**
- Enables encoding of JSONB objects into CBOR format and decoding CBOR data back into JSONB format.

### **4. Blake2b Hashing:**
- Provides Blake2b cryptographic hashing, which allows users to hash data with an output length configurable between 1 and 64 bytes.

### **5. Ed25519 Digital Signatures:**
- Allows creation of Ed25519 signatures using a provided secret key, as well as verification of signatures using the corresponding public key.

---

### **6. Cardano-specific Tools:**

#### **DRep ID Builders (CIP-105 and CIP-129 Support):**
- The extension supports the encoding of DRep IDs (Delegated Representative Identifiers) using both CIP-105 and CIP-129 formats.

#### **Shelley Address Builders and Extractors:**
- Create Shelley-era addresses (base, enterprise, reward) using payment and/or stake credentials, with support for both keyhash and script credentials.
- Extract payment and stake credentials from Bech32 Shelley addresses.
- Identify the type of Shelley address (e.g., payment-key, stake-key, script-key, etc.), making it easier to categorize and process addresses within PostgreSQL queries.
