# v1.0.4 - Asset Name Reader implementation
By standard, all `asset_name` strings should be encoded as `hex`. However, they could also be just `hex`, not  a UTF-8 string.

Many developers have to use something like this:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION "convert_asset_name"("name" bytea) RETURNS "varchar"
AS
$$
BEGIN
    return convert_from("name", 'utf-8');
EXCEPTION
    WHEN character_not_in_repertoire
        THEN
            return encode("name", 'hex');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE "plpgsql";
```

It works, but it could work better! So, it was reimplemented in Rust to be more robust.

## Release Notes:
The `tools_read_asset_name` function has been added. It helps handle asset_name values that may be either UTF-8 strings or raw hexadecimal values. If the input is valid UTF-8, it is returned as a string. Otherwise, the function encodes it in hex format.
