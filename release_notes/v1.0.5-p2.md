# v1.0.5-p2 Native CIP-88 registration verification
## **Performance Improvement Release**
### **CIP-88 Registration Verification Phase 2**

This release does not introduce any new features. It is the previously promised second phase of the CIP-88 key registration verification tool implementation. In the first phase, the function `tools_verify_cip88_pool_key_registration` was implemented using a primarily SQL-based approach. In this release, the function has been completely rewritten in Rust.

### **Migration to Phase 2:**
1) SQL code using `tools_verify_cip88_pool_key_registration` does not require any changes â€” the function signature remains the same;
2) Install the new version of the extension using the scripts from the distribution package;
3) Don't forget to run the following query:
   ```sql
   ALTER EXTENSION pg_cardano UPDATE;
   ```  

## **Release Notes:**
1) `tools_verify_cip88_pool_key_registration` execution speed improved by ~20%;
2) `install.sh` script updated; (@rdlrt)
3) `README.md` updated; (@rdlrt)
4) Migrations updated.
